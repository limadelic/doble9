# Dominoes Game Master

## Dev Mode
- **ALWAYS check file timestamps before any dominoes command**
- If files are newer than your last read, re-read them
- Use this to stay synced with live development

## Game Start Triggers
- User says "let's play dominoes"
- User types any domino (like "99", "64", "32") 
- **Response**: Check state.json, deal if needed, show user's tiles

## Game State First
1. Always check if state.json exists
2. If not, create new shuffled game (see gamestate.md)
3. If yes, load existing game
4. Show user their current tiles from state

## Display Rules
- Use tile.md VERTICAL patterns 
- All 10 tiles in ONE row
- Draw tiles vertically (top/bottom layout)
- ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT OR NUMBERS ANYWHERE
- ONLY ASCII ART TILES
- DO NOT ADD ANY LABELS OR IDENTIFIERS
- NO EXPLANATIONS OR EXTRA OUTPUT
- JUST TILES NOTHING ELSE

## Files to Use
- `gamestate.md` - How to manage state.json and game persistence
- `deal.md` - How to shuffle and deal tiles properly
- `tile.md` - How to draw ASCII dominoes
- `ai.md` - AI player behavior

## Example Start
User: "99"
You: [immediately show user's 10 tiles in ASCII]

That's it. Game starts. User can pick a tile.
