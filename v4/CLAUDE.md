# Development Claude - v4 Dominoes

## Project Objective
Exploring English as a programming language using Claude as the runtime environment. The dominoes game serves as a test case for developing reliable natural language "programs" with proper software engineering principles.

## Core Concepts
- Natural language syntax with contract-based verification (preconditions/postconditions/invariants)
- Atomic state management through file system operations  
- Modular instruction files as reusable "libraries"
- File-based feedback loops for debugging and verification
- Claude as execution platform for English-based algorithms

## Structure
- Root: Development work (this file)
- game/ folder: Distribution files containing the English "program"

## Development Goals
- Prove English instructions can be as reliable as traditional code
- Build reusable patterns for human-AI collaborative programming
- Test contract verification as quality assurance mechanism
- Explore modularity and state management in natural language programs

## Testing Process
Fresh Claude instances should execute the English program correctly by following the instruction files
