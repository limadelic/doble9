# V4 Dominoes Project Context

## Current State
- Game auto-starts via CLAUDE.md
- Clean contract-based instruction files (preconditions/postconditions)
- start.md: simple todo list (cp state0.json, Deal, Sort, Display)
- deal.md: working with proper preconditions/postconditions
- display.md: has examples but still produces text instead of ASCII art
- sort.md: has examples but sorting logic is complex

## Key Issues Yesterday
1. Display not working - shows text "05, 49, 55" instead of ASCII tiles
2. Sorting algorithm too complex for reliable execution
3. Examples have errors (miscounted domino numbers)

## Recent Progress
- Fixed display.md to write ASCII art to OUT.md file instead of direct output
- Tested full game flow: deal, sort, display all work
- File-based display is much more reliable and lets user see tiles in editor

## Next Steps
Continue refining game instructions as needed
